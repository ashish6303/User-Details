# User-Details
This is a full-stack project designed to explore and solidify your understanding of front-end and back-end development concepts. It utilizes React for the user interface and Spring Boot for the server-side logic, demonstrating how these technologies can work together to create a robust application.

Key Technologies
. Front-end: React
. Back-end: Spring Boot
. API Communication: Axios
. Database: SQL (specific database to be specified, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
. Database Management: SQL Workbench
. Project Learning Objectives

Front-End (React):
. Routing: Master navigating between different UI components within the application.
. Hooks: Leverage React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) to manage component state and side effects effectively.
. API Integration: Seamlessly interact with back-end APIs using Axios.

Back-End (Spring Boot):
. API Development: Create RESTful APIs that provide data and functionality to the front-end.
. Server-Side Logic: Implement business logic and data processing on the server.
